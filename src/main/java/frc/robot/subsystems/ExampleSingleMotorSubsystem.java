     * "public": this keyword allows anything inside or outside of the class to access the element it's used on.  For example, this
     * class is a public class, and can be called from any file within this project
     * 
     * "protected": this keyword is used to limit access to only the class it's defined in, or any subclasses of that class.  In this case,
     * the "motorSpeed" variable below is used in this class here, and in the subclass "ExampleDoubleMotorSubsystem".  Outside of that,
     * no other file may access this variable.
     * 
     * "private": this keyword restricts usage of the element it's used on to only be usable within the class it's created in.  No other files
     * or classes, even subclasses of the class that it's used in, may access that element.
